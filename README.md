## My process

I started with the mobile aspect first. I looked at the mobile image and designed the HTML structure around that. From there I setup the CSS styling with custom properties identified in the style guide, and a basic reset, which is also a .css file in the repository. Styling then began from the top and outer elements and containers, to the elements within, and moving downward.

I'm also deploying on Netlify using a github workflow.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I researched a lot about box-shadow, clamp and display CSS properties. I'm also deploying on Netlify using a github workflow.

```css
box-shadow: 3px 1px 5px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.21), 3px 3px 11px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);

font-size: clamp(1.7rem, 4vw, 2.4rem);
```
